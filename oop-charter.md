# [Open-O] Project Charter

The Linux Foundation

Effective 22 January 2016

## 1. Mission of [Open-O] Project (“OOP”).

The mission of OOP is to:
 
1. create an enterprise grade, open source MANO and SDN orchestration framework and code base, upon which end user service providers can build and run robust, industry-specific applications, platforms and hardware systems to support cloud, NFV and SDN environments.

2. create an open source, technical community to benefit the ecosystem of OOP solution providers and users, focused on network orchestration use cases that will work across a variety of industry solutions;

3. promote participation of leading members of the ecosystem, including developers, service and solution providers and end users; and

4. host the infrastructure for OOP, establishing a neutral home for community infrastructure, meetings, events and collaborative discussions and providing structure around the business and technical governance of OOP.

## 2. Membership.

1. OOP shall be composed of Premier, General and Associate Members. All Premier and General Members must be current corporate members of The Linux Foundation (at any level) to participate in OOP as a member. Anyone may propose a contribution to OOP’s technical codebase regardless of membership status. All participants in OOP, including Associate Members, enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this [Open-O] Project Charter, as from time to time amended by the Governing Board with the approval of The Linux Foundation (“LF”). During the term of their membership, all members will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the OOP may from time to time adopt with notice to members.

2. The Associate Member category of membership is limited to non-profits and open source projects, and requires approval by the Governing Board of OOP (“Governing Board”), or, if the Governing Board sets criteria for joining as an Associate Member, the meeting of such criteria. If the Associate Member is a membership organization, Associate Membership in OOP does not confer any benefits or rights to the members of the Associate Member.

3. Premier Members shall be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board in the event that there are fewer than sixteen (16) Governing Board representatives appointed by the Premier Members in total. In the event that there are sixteen (16) Governing Board representatives appointed by the Premier Members in total, then the Premier Members shall be entitled to annually elect sixteen (16) representatives to the Governing Board. Premier Members shall be entitled to appoint a representative to the Marketing Committee and any other committees established by the Governing Board.

4. General Members shall be entitled to annually elect one representative to the Governing Board for every ten (10) General Members, up to a maximum of four (4) representatives, provided that there shall always be at least one (1) General Member representative, if there are one (1) or more General Members, even if there are less than ten (10) General Members. The election process shall be determined by the Governing Board.

5. Premier Members, General Members and Associate Members shall be entitled to:

  1. participate in Project general meetings, initiatives, events and any other activities; and

  2. identify themselves as members of, or participants in, OOP.

2. Quorum for Governing Board, TSC, Marketing Committee or EU-TAB meetings shall require the presence of at least two-thirds of the voting representatives and representation of the lesser of four (4) members or 50% of the total members represented on that body. The Governing Board, TSC, Marketing Committee or EU-TAB may continue to meet if quorum is not met, but shall be prevented from making any decisions at the meeting.

1. All members shall abide by The Linux Foundation Antitrust Policy available at http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy.

2. All members shall encourage open participation from any organization able to meet the membership requirements, regardless of competitive interests. Put another way, the Governing Board shall not seek to exclude any member based on any criteria, requirements or reasons other than those that are reasonable and applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all members.

## 9. Code of Conduct

The Governing Board shall adopt a specific Project code of conduct, with approval from the LF.

## 10. Budget

1. The Governing Board shall approve an annual budget and never commit to spend in excess of funds raised. The budget and the purposes to which it is applied shall be consistent with the non-profit mission of The Linux Foundation.

## 11. General & Administrative Expenses

1. The Linux Foundation shall have custody of and final authority over the usage of any fees, funds and other cash receipts.

2. A General & Administrative (G&A) fee will be applied by the Linux Foundation to funds raised to cover Finance, Accounting, and operations. The G&A fee shall equal 9% of OOP’s first $1,000,000 of gross receipts and 6% of OOP’s gross receipts over $1,000,000.

3. Under no circumstances shall The Linux Foundation be expected or required to undertake any action on behalf of OOP that is inconsistent with the tax exempt purpose of The Linux Foundation.

## 12. General Rules and Operations. The OOP project shall be conducted so as to:
