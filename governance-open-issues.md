#### \[Board\]
- The size and composition of the Governing Board.

		- Consensus to Set an expectation (but not a hard requirement) in the charter for when the transition will happen - e.g. 2 releases - but leave the details to be sorted out by the start-up TSC. The transition plan should be approved by the Board, so that appropriate oversight is in place.
