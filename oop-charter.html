<h1 id="open-orchestrator-project-charter">Open-Orchestrator Project Charter</h1>
<p><strong>The Linux Foundation</strong><br />
<em>Effective 17 February 2016</em></p>
<h2 id="mission-of-open-orchestrator-project.">1. Mission of Open-Orchestrator Project.</h2>
<p>The mission of the Open-Orchestrator Project (“OOP”) is to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>create a carrier grade MANO and SDN orchestration framework, implemented and released as open source software, supporting common data models and interoperability across multiple VIMs, upon which end user service providers can build and run robust network services including industry-specific applications in support of cloud, NFV, and SDN environments;</p></li>
<li><p>create an open source, technical community to benefit the ecosystem of OOP solution providers and users, focused on network orchestration use cases that will work across a variety of industry solutions;</p></li>
<li><p>promote participation of leading members of the ecosystem, including developers, service and solution providers, and end users; and</p></li>
<li><p>host the infrastructure for OOP, establishing a neutral home for community infrastructure, meetings, events, and collaborative discussions and providing structure around the business and technical governance of OOP.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="membership.">2. Membership.</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>OOP shall be composed of Premier, General, and Associate Members. All Premier and General Members must be current corporate members of The Linux Foundation (at any level) to participate in OOP as a member. Anyone may propose a contribution to OOP’s technical codebase regardless of membership status. All participants in OOP, including Associate Members, enjoy the privileges and undertake the obligations described in this Open-Orchestrator Charter, as from time to time amended by the Governing Board with the approval of The Linux Foundation (“LF”). During the term of their membership, all members will comply with all such policies as the LF Board of Directors and/or the OOP may from time to time adopt with notice to members.</p></li>
<li><p>The Associate Member category of membership is limited to non-profits and open source projects, and requires approval by the Governing Board of OOP (“Governing Board”), or, if the Governing Board sets criteria for joining as an Associate Member, the meeting of such criteria. If the Associate Member is a membership organization, Associate Membership in OOP does not confer any benefits or rights to the members of the Associate Member.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benson: Note that there is no membership class for Individuals</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Premier Members shall be entitled to appoint a representative to the Governing Board in the event that there are sixteen (16) or fewer Premier Members. In the event that there are more than sixteen (16) Premier Members then the Premier Members shall be entitled to annually elect sixteen (16) representatives to the Governing Board. The election process shall be determined by the Governing Board. Premier Members shall be entitled to appoint a representative to the Marketing Committee and any other committees established by the Governing Board.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benson: Note that this caps the number of Premier Board members rather than the number of Premier members; this is significantly different from the earlier draft version of this charter.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>General Members shall be entitled to annually elect one representative to the Governing Board for every ten (10) General Members, up to a maximum of four (4) representatives, provided that there shall always be at least one (1) General Member representative if there are one (1) or more General Members, even if there are less than ten (10) General Members. The election process shall be determined by the Governing Board.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benson: Note that this provides for more Board members representing General members than the previous version</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Premier Members, General Members and Associate Members shall be entitled to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>participate in Project general meetings, initiatives, events and any other activities; and</p></li>
<li><p>identify themselves as members of, or participants in, OOP.</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="governing-board">3. Governing Board</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Composition – the Governing Board voting members shall consist of:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>up to sixteen (16) representatives appointed or elected by Premier Members per Section 2.c.;</p></li>
<li><p>up to four (4) representatives elected by General Members per Section 2.d.;</p></li>
<li><p>one (1) representative elected by the End User Technical Advisory Board per Section 6; and</p></li>
<li><p>one (1) representative of the TSC, per Section 4;</p></li>
<li><p>except that no Member shall have more than one (1) vote on the Governing Board or any committee.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benson: Note that this last bullet makes it possible that multiple Board members must choose how to cast a single vote</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Conduct of Meetings</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Governing Board meetings shall be limited to the Governing Board representatives and follow the requirements for quorum and voting outlined in this Charter. The Governing Board may decide whether to allow each representative to appoint a named representative to attend as an alternate.</p></li>
<li><p>The Governing Board meetings shall be confidential unless approved by the Governing Board. The Governing Board may invite guests to participate in consideration of specific Governing Board topics (but such guest may not participate in any vote on any matter before the Governing Board). The Governing Board should encourage transparency, including publication of public minutes within a reasonable time following their approval by the Governing Board.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Responsibilities – the Governing Board shall be responsible for:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Setting and maintaining the scope, vision, and policy of the OOP;</p></li>
<li><p>approving a budget and directing the use of funds raised by OOP from all sources of revenue;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benson: the extra language about allowable activities and tax-exempt operation is not necessary in the case of a LF directed project.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>electing a Chair of OOP to preside over Governing Board meetings, authorize expenditures approved by the budget, and manage any day-to-day operations;</p></li>
<li><p>overseeing all Project business, legal, and marketing matters, including the creation and oversight of subcommittees for any aspects of its business;</p></li>
<li><p>adopt and maintain policies or rules and procedures for OOP (subject to LF approval) including but not limited to a Code of Conduct, a trademark policy, and any compliance or certification policies;</p></li>
<li><p>working with the TSC on defining and administering any programs for certification, including any Project certification or processes for OOP;</p></li>
<li><p>coordinating with the EU-TAB (as defined in Section 6 below) to enable End User adoption, inclusion in technical community conversations, and overall participation in OOP;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benson: I think the charter should not require the board to define Vision and Scope based on EU-TAB direction; that effectively would transplant Board authority into the EU-TAB and make the Board a figurehead.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>approving procedures for the nomination and election of representatives to the Governing Board from the General Members, and from the Premier Members if applicable;</p></li>
<li><p>approving procedures for the nomination and election of any officer or other positions created by the Governing Board; and</p></li>
<li><p>voting on all decisions or matters coming before the Governing Board.</p></li>

<blockquote>
<p>Benson: This limits votes to 2 per member, but doesn't limit individuals holding seats; thus some members may in theory have to figure out how to cast their votes collectively.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Steady State: After the Startup Period and upon approval by the Governing Board, to be given if the community has reached adequate stability, maturity, and diversity, there shall be a nomination and election period for electing Contributors or Maintainers to the TSC.

<ol>
<li><p>coordinating the technical direction of OOP in conformance with the strategic scope set by the Governing Board;</p></li>

<li><p>non-voting representative(s) appointed by members of any other class of membership; and</p></li>
<li><p>non-voting representative(s) appointed by the TSC.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Responsibilities: The Marketing Committee shall be responsible for designing, developing and executing marketing efforts on behalf of the Governing Board.
